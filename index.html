						<div class="content">
							<p>Hi, and welcome to my portfolio website!
								<br/>
								<br/>
								My name is <strong>Sjoerd de Jonge</strong>. I am a <span id="age">27</span> year old MSc student in Industrial Design Engineering at the University of Twente. I am a curious person
								and designer, eager to learn and easily fascinated. This led me to dive
								into a wide range of topics, such as image processing, computer vision, augmented reality,
								intelligent transport, UI/UX, graphic design and much more. <br/>
								As a designer, I can turn ideas into concepts. My interest in the technical side of things helps
								to translate these concepts into finished products. Besides industrial design, I have acquired an interest in programming and
								have completed several projects in different programming languages.

											The Range Extender Trailer (RET) is a trailer that can
											extend the range of a battery electric vehicle (BEV).
											Users can rent the trailer for
											holidays to reduce or avoid charging stops during
											their trip. The assignment focussed on the system
											perspective of the case and included making a business case to calculate the potential market share and
											income of this service. An interactive model was made to showcase the effect of design requirements on
											several technical aspects of the product (for example: the effect of average driving speed on total range).

											For this project, I worked in a group of 4 total, a mix of Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Design Engineering students.
											Besides the general idea (sketching) and concept generation, my contribution to this project also consisted of creating a business
											case for the product. The systems engineering perspective of the project was also part of the main focus in this project.

										<h3>Text Camera App</h3>
										<p>Inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2IwAKmY774" target="_blank">this music video</a>, I asked
											myself if I could write an algorithm that translates images to text. After making an initial prototype in MATLAB, I decided to
											take it one step further and develop my first <strong>Android app</strong>! <br/>

											<p style="margin: 1.25rem 0 0 0;">
												The goal of this project was to translate a grayscale image into a matrix of text characters. I wrote a prototype script in <strong>MATLAB</strong>
												as a proof of concept. After seeing the results, I was curious what it would look like on a real time camera feed.
												While this can be done in MATLAB, I decided to take this project as an opportunity to learn how to develop Android apps. Working on this project has
												taught me to use the <strong>Android Studio</strong> development environment and make apps by using the Kotlin programming language.  <br/>
												<br/>
												<video autoplay loop src="images/textcameravid.mp4" width=100% height=auto style="position: relative;margin:0rem 0 1.25rem 0" alt=""></video>
												<br/>
												This app uses the <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/camerax" target="_blank">CameraX library</a> to obtain the
												grayscale values of the camera preview feed. The pixels are then grouped in blocks and for each block the
												average grayscale value is calculated. Next, this grayscale value is linked to a character in a pre-determined
												array of text characters. And finally, all characters are displayed in the app on a TextView. The user can
												take pictures with a long-press on the screen.

										<h3>Haptic Stylus</h3>
										<p>The haptic stylus was the answer to make the drawing experience on digital tablets feel more realistic. This project was done for the course Surface Engineering for Look and Feel.
										The main focus of the project was on formulating a good research proposal and executing desk research.</p>
									</header>

										</div>

										<span id = "moreHS" style="display: none;">
											<p style="margin: 1.25rem 0 0 0;">
												The goal of the haptic stylus is to recreate that characteristic feeling of drawing with a pen (or pencil) on paper.
												Findings from literature research conclude that the two main factors contributing to this feeling are friction and vibrations. The characteristic friction can
												already be replicated by using pen tips made from different materials for the stylus, but the vibrations are a result of the pencil tip moving over the texture
												of a paper sheet—which does not happen on the smooth surface of a drawing tablet. The haptic stylus creates micro vibrations in a pattern that matches speed of the stylus and the
												type of paper it tries to replicate. By analysing different sheets of paper, different profiles can be set up that mimic multiple pen-paper combinations.

										<p style="margin: 1.25rem 0 0 0;">
											During this project I learned to apply several <strong>design methods</strong> to design innovative concepts,
											such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIZ" target="_blank">TRIZ</a> or the Delft Innovation Method.
											The course taught me about the different ways how new technologies can be adopted by a market.
											Working as a group of 3 IDE students, the goal was to develop a conceptual design of a
											product-service combination for solar powered EV charging solutions. <br/>

												<a href="images/gallery/fulls/tile3.jpg"><img src="images/gallery/thumbs/tile3.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											</div>
											<br/>
											By applying these innovative design methods, a concept was formed out of the ideas from a
											brainstorm session. After refining the concept, the interface of an accompanying app was created.
											The app ties into the service aspect of the assignment, by allowing the users to reserve charging spots
											on the bus and even request a preferred location for the bus to drive to. This was designed to solve the range anxiety
											that some people have with EVs in cases where there are not enough charging spots available.

												<h3>Bachelor Assignment</h3>
												<p>
													<strong>Augmented Reality</strong> (AR) is a promising technology
													for the factory floor.
													For my final assignment in the bachelor of Industrial Design,
													I worked at Benchmark Electronics in Almelo to investigate how
													an AR headset can be used as a guiding tool for an assembly operator
													in a factory.

													<p style="margin: 1.25rem 0 1.25rem 0;">
														During this project I worked at Benchmark Electronics to design and test the use
														of the Microsoft HoloLens (an augmented reality headset) at the manufacturing department.
														Research has shown that using <strong>augmented reality</strong> (AR) as a tool for giving <strong>assembly instructions</strong>
														can result in a faster assembly time and a lower error rate. There are still several challenges
														that I investigated, including the increased effort required to create these new type of assembly instructions.
														<br/>
														<br/>
														After making a prototype set of instructions for the HoloLens (using the Unity3D engine), I tested
														the use of this prototype with an assembly operator. I concluded the assignment by giving two different
														concepts for the implementation of AR in assembly. In this project I got to observe how a real manufacturing
														environment functions, learn the workflow of a company, learned how to design AR applications and learned how to program these AR applications for the HoloLens.
